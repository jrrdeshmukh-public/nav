# Game-Theoretic Knowledge Base for Financial Index Modeling

## Overview

This system implements a **game-theoretic player-action trace and knowledge evolution framework** for building dynamic financial indices. Each player models a strategic agent navigating financial decisions, and the evolution of their choices is framed through a game tree, updated via historical backtesting.

The system is composed of:
- `Node`, `NodeLink`, `Triad`
- `KnowledgeBase`
- `Trace`
- `FinancialIndex`

The primary objective is to **simulate strategic decision-making** under dynamic market conditions using **game-theoretic principles**.

## Game-Theoretic Formulation

### 1. Node, NodeLink, and Triad Structures

- **Node**: Represents a strategic entity (Player) or an available move (Action) within the game tree.
- **NodeLink**: Encodes transitions between nodes based on chosen actions.
- **Triad**: Models a local payoff structure `(Player, Action, Payoff)`, central to evaluating strategic outcomes.

Each Player at a Node seeks to optimize payoffs, leading to decision-making trees that resemble multi-stage, sequential games.

---

### 2. KnowledgeBase

The `KnowledgeBase` maintains a dynamic repository of triad sequences classified as:
- **Best Responses**: Optimal strategies historically observed.
- **Ignored Paths**: Suboptimal but permissible strategies.
- **Worst Responses**: Detrimental strategic choices.

The system uses this evolving corpus to:
- Evaluate new strategies against historical "equilibria".
- Influence future moves based on knowledge-driven priors.
- Promote learning through reinforcement of high-payoff paths.

This parallels **experience-based reinforcement** in repeated strategic games.

### 3. Trace

`Trace` constructs a **finite game tree**:
- **Recursive Expansion**: At each node, generate child actions and subsequent players.
- **Liquidity and Payoff Modeling**: Each move impacts payoffs and market liquidity, affecting subsequent stages.
- **Trace Evaluation**:
  - Best responses are traced against the knowledge base.
  - Graph structures are generated for visualization.

Overall, each trace is a **path-dependent strategic simulation**, evolving with knowledge.

### 4. FinancialIndex

`FinancialIndex` models the **meta-game**:
- Each symbol represents a "player" in a broader financial environment.
- Players' strategies (investment weights) evolve through historical backtesting.
- The index dynamically updates based on player performance (payoffs).

**Backtesting Phase**:
- Master players are initialized for each asset.
- Historical returns guide the simulation of sequential moves.
- Triads update the knowledge base after each iteration.

**Online Phase**:
- Real-time adjustments to weights based on latest strategic assessments.
- Evolving the "optimal play" in a shifting financial landscape.

## System Flow Summary

1. **KnowledgeBase** initializes strategic memory.
2. **FinancialIndex** initializes players (symbols).
3. **Backtesting** simulates repeated plays, evolving knowledge.
4. **Online adaptation** refines strategies dynamically.
5. **Trace Export** visualizes evolving strategies.

## Notable Game-Theoretic Features

- **Sequential Decision Games**: Players evolve strategies stage-by-stage.
- **Knowledge-Driven Equilibrium Search**: Best responses are reinforced across iterations.
- **Reinforcement Learning via Payoff Traces**: High-payoff paths expand the strategic memory.
- **Dynamic Environment Modeling**: Symbol returns change over time, forcing adaptive plays.

## Potential Applications

- **Game-Theoretic Algorithmic Trading**
- **Multi-Agent Financial Simulations**
- **Strategic Backtesting Engines**
- **Explainable AI in Finance**

## Limitations and Future Improvements

- Currently assumes perfect historical knowledge and deterministic transitions.
- Expansion toward stochastic games and partial observability could enhance realism.
- Efficiency improvements in memory management needed.
- Live data integration will allow continuous real-time adaptation.

## Example Usage (Main Function)

```cpp
int main() {
    FinancialIndex* fid = new FinancialIndex("./ai_agent/symbols.txt", "./ai_agent/index_values.csv", "./ai_agent/weights.csv");

    string start_date = "2023-03-02 00:00:00";
    string end_date = "2023-08-31 00:00:00";

    fid->run_backtest("./ai_agent/historical_bars.json", start_date, end_date);
    fid->store_historical_index_values();
    fid->store_weights();

    return 0;
}
```

# Conclusion

This system models **strategic, knowledge-evolving financial decision making** as a sequence of game-theoretic interactions. By combining dynamic payoffs, evolving best-response knowledge bases, and reinforcement-style learning, it paves the way for robust, explainable, adaptive financial systems.
